      <h3>General Information:</h3>
      <p>This is a PHP Chat based on LE CHAT v.1.14. An up-to-date copy of this script can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/DanWin/le-chat-php">here</a><br>
      The original perl LE CHAT script by Lucky Eddie can be downloaded at <a href="http://4fvfamdpoulu2nms.onion/lechat/">his site</a> or via a tor2web proxy like <a href="https://4fvfamdpoulu2nms.onion.to/lechat/">this one</a> if you don't have TOR installed.<br>
      If you add your own cool features or have a feature request, please tell me and I will add them, if I like them.<br>
      Please also let me know about any bugs you find in the code, so I can fix them.<br>
      Now a piece of information about the origin of the name "LE CHAT" copied from the original script:<br>
      The "LE" in the name you can take as  "Lucky Eddie", or since the script was meant to be lean and easy on server resources, as "Light Edition".<br>
      It may even be the French word for "the" if you prefer. Translated from French to English, "le chat" means: "the cat".</p>

      <h3>Installation Instructions:</h3>

      <p>You'll need to have php with pdo, pcre and date extension and a web-server installed.<br>
      You will also need the pdo_sqlite, pdo_mysql or pdo_pgsql extension, depending on which database you choose.<br>
      Optionally, you can install:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>the gd extension for the captcha feature</li>
        <li>the json extension for save/restore and a JavaScript helper for clients with enabled JavaScript.</li>
        <li>a memcached server and the memcached extension and change the configuaration to use memcached. This will lessen the database load a bit.</li>
        <li>a MySQL or PostgreSQL server to use as an external database instead of SQLite</li>
        <li>the openssl extension for encryption of messages and notes in the database</li>
      </ul>
      When you have everything installed and use MySQL or PostgreSQL, you'll have to create a database and a user for the chat.<br>
      Then edit the configuration at the bottom of the script to reflect the appropriate database settings and to modify the chat settings the way you like them.<br>
      Then copy the script to your web-server directory and call the script in your browser with a parameter like this:<br>
      &nbsp; http://(server)/(script-name).php?action=setup<br>
      Now you can create the Superadmin account. With this account you can administer the chat and add new members and set the guest access.<br>
      As soon as you are done with the setup, all necessary database tables will be created and the chat can be used.<br>
      Note: If you updated the script, please visit http://(server)/(script-name).php?action=setup again, to make sure, that any database changes are applied and no errors occure.</p>

      <h3>Translating:</h3>

      <p>Copy lang_en.php and rename it to lang_YOUR_LANGCODE.php<br>
      Then edit the file and translate the messages into your language and change $I to $T at the top.<br>
      If you ever use a ' character, you have to escape it by using \' instead or the script will fail.<br>
      When you are done, you have to edit the chat script, to include your translation. Simply add a line with<br>
      &nbsp; 'lang_code' => 'Language name',<br>
      to the $L array in the load_lang() function at the bottom, similar to what I did for the German translation.<br>
      Please share your translation with me, so I can add it to the official version.<br>
      To update your translation, you can copy each new string to your translation file or edit the automated lang_update.php script to reflect you language and run it.</p>

      <h3>Regex:</h3>

      <p>Yes, the chat supports regular expression filtering of messages. As regex tends to be difficult for most people, I decided to give it an extra section here.<br>
      Regex is very powerful and can be used to filter messages that contain certain expressions and replace them with something else.<br>
      It can be used e.g. to turn BB Code into html, so it is possible to use BB Code in the chat to format messages.<br>
      To do this, use this Regex-Match '\[(u|b)\](.*?)\[\/\1\]' and this Regex-Replace '<$1>$2</$1>' and your text will be '[b]bold[/b]' or '[u]underlined[/u]'.<br>
      You can also use smilies by using this Regex-Match '(?-i::(cry|eek|lol|sad|smile|surprised|wink):)' and this Regex-Replace '&lt;img src="/pictures/$1.gif" alt=":$1:"&gt;'<br>
      And now if you enter ':smile:' an image with the smiley will be loaded from your server at '/pictures/smile.gif'.<br>
      The following should be escaped by putting '\' in front of it, if you are trying to match one of these characters '/ \ ^ . $ | ( ) [ ] * + ? { } ,'.<br>
      I used '/' as delimiter, so you will have to escape that, too. The only options I used is 'i' to make the regex case insensitive.<br>
      If you want to test your regex, before applying you can use <a href="http://www.phpliveregex.com/">this site</a> and enter your Regex and Replacement there and click on preg_replace.<br>
      If you never used regex before, check out <a href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/4.4/regex-intro.html">this starting guide</a> to begin with regular expressions.</p>

      <h3>Live demo:</h3>

      <p>If you want to see the script in action, you can visit my <a href="http://tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion/chat.php">TOR hidden service</a> or via a tor2web proxy like <a href="http://tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion.to/chat.php">this one</a> if you don't have TOR installed.<br>
      Considering this is a hidden service, you should be prepared for the worst case, as people often tend to do illegal activities in the TOR network. I'm not online 24/7 so it might not be possible to remove such content right away.<br>
      If you should see illegal content, don't panic. Use the contact form on my site to notify me and clean your browser cache afterwards. I will remove the content as soon as possible.</p>
